# About Time (v13.0.6.4)

**About Time** is a timekeeping and event scheduling utility for Foundry VTT.  
It works with **Simple Calendar** (if installed) or falls back to Foundry‚Äôs core time system.

---

## üì¶ Installation

1. Download and install via Foundry‚Äôs module browser  
   **OR** add the manifest URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/paulcheeba/about-time-v13/releases/latest/download/module.json
   ```
2. Enable the module in your world.
3. (Optional) Install [Simple Calendar](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/foundryvtt-simple-calendar) for advanced date formatting.
4. (Optional) Install [Smalltime](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/smalltime) to advance time with a UI. Otherwise, macros or About Time‚Äôs **AT Time Manager** panel can be used to advance time.

## üÜï What‚Äôs new in v13.0.6.4

- **AT Time Manager mini panel** (GM-only controls; players see time-only):  
  - Windowless, draggable panel with **Pause** / **Play** flanking the time.  
  - Five configurable step buttons: **RWD1**, **RWD2**, **FFWD1**, **FFWD2**, **FFWD3**.  
  - New ‚Äútime-of-day‚Äù buttons: **Dawn**, **Noon**, **Dusk**, **Midnight**.  
  - Time display ticks once per second and updates immediately on changes.  
  - Uses **Simple Calendar** formatting when SC is active; else shows `DD:HH:MM:SS`.
- **Toolbar tool** under **Journal/Notes**: **About Time - Time Manager** (GM-only) to toggle the mini panel.
- **Behavior toggles** (see Settings):  
  - *Safety Lock* (master switch)  
  - *Disable while paused*  
  - *Disable during combat*  
  - *Auto-pause on combat start/resume on last end*
- Per-user **position persistence** and live updates when you change step/dawn/dusk settings.

> ‚úÖ Non-destructive: all existing About Time features and APIs remain intact.

## ‚öô Settings

### Use Simple Calendar (if installed)
- **Default:** On  
- When on and SC is active, About Time uses SC‚Äôs date/time formatting and intervals.  
- When off or SC is missing, About Time uses Foundry‚Äôs core time (`t+seconds`).

### AT Time Manager (Mini Panel)

**Client (per-user) settings**
- **Enable AT Time Manager** ‚Äî Show the mini panel on load for this user. GMs see controls; players see time-only.  
- **RWD1 / RWD2 / FFWD1 / FFWD2 / FFWD3 durations** ‚Äî Set each button‚Äôs duration using `/at`-style tokens: `10s`, `1m`, `1h5m3s`, etc.  
- **Dawn time (HH:MM)** ‚Äî default `06:00`  
- **Dusk time (HH:MM)** ‚Äî default `18:00`

**World (per-world) settings**
- **Safety Lock: never advance while paused or during combat** ‚Äî Master safety. When enabled, About Time will not change game time while the game is paused or during active combat. The two options below are effectively disabled.  
- **Disable step buttons while paused** ‚Äî default Off. When On, step buttons are disabled if the world is paused. When Off, the GM can still advance time while paused.  
- **Disable step buttons during active combat** ‚Äî default Off. When On, step buttons are disabled whenever a combat is active.  
- **Auto-pause on combat start (resume when last ends)** ‚Äî default On. If enabled, starting the first combat pauses the game; ending the last combat resumes. The panel shows a small pill indicating ‚ÄúCombat controls time‚Äù.

> Turning **Enable AT Time Manager** on/off prompts a reload so the toolbar & panel reflect your changes immediately.

## ü™ü AT Time Manager Panel

- **GM view**: Pause/Play, five step buttons, and four time-of-day buttons (Dawn/Noon/Dusk/Midnight).  
- **Player view**: time-only (no buttons).
- **Behavior**:  
  - Buttons advance or rewind using **core FVTT v13** `game.time.advance(...)`.  
  - Dawn/Dusk/Noon/Midnight jump **forward** to the next occurrence (today or tomorrow).  
  - Optional disables when paused or during combat (see Settings), plus a master **Safety Lock**.  
  - 1-second heartbeat for a clock-like display; also listens to world time updates for instant refresh.  
- **Toolbar toggle**: **About Time - Time Manager** under **Journal/Notes** (GM-only).  
- **Position**: draggable; last position is saved per user.

## üó£ /at Chat Command

- `/at help` ‚Äî list available commands  
- `/at queue` or `/at list` ‚Äî show the queue  
- `/at clear` ‚Äî clear the entire queue  
- `/at stop <uid>` ‚Äî cancel a specific event by its UID  
- `/at in <duration> <message>` ‚Äî schedule one-time reminder  
- `/at every <duration> <message>` ‚Äî schedule repeating reminder

**Duration shorthand:** supports mixed units ‚Äî `1h30m`, `2d 4h`, `45m10s`, or plain seconds.

**Examples**
- `/at help`  
- `/at in 10m Check the stew`  
- `/at every 1h Random Encounter`  
- `/at stop abc123(uid)`  
- `/at clear`  
- `/at in 10 Time for a coffee break!`

> Tip: You can also control time via the **AT Time Manager** panel (GM-only), which uses core `game.time.advance(...)` under the hood.

---

## ‚è± Macro Examples

**Advance by 30 seconds (core FVTT v13):**
```js
await game.time.advance(30);
```

**Schedule a Macro to Run in 5 Minutes (About Time):**
```js
game.abouttime.doIn({ minutes: 5 }, () => {
  ui.notifications.info("Five minutes have passed!");
});
```

**Schedule a Reminder at a Specific Game Time:**
```js
game.abouttime.reminderAt(
  { hour: 12, minute: 0, second: 0 },
  "It is high noon!"
);
```

**Repeat Every Round (6 seconds):**
```js
game.abouttime.doEvery({ seconds: 6 }, () => {
  console.log("New combat round started!");
});
```

**Trigger a Custom Hook in 30 Seconds:**
```js
game.abouttime.notifyIn({ seconds: 30 }, "myCustomEvent", "arg1", "arg2");
```

## üß™ Testing Without Simple Calendar

If Simple Calendar is not installed or disabled:
- Times in output appear as `DD:HH:MM:SS` or `t+<seconds>`.
- All scheduling functions still work the same.
- The mini panel still works; time-of-day buttons compute forward boundaries by seconds-of-day.
