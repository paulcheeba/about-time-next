Hey everyone — major update for About Time Next!

After years of waiting, Simple Calendar has been forked and updated for Foundry v13+ as **Simple Calendar Reborn** by Arctis Fireblight. This release brings full SCR integration with proper time authority delegation, plus a new calendar selection dialog.

## What you'll notice

- **Simple Calendar Reborn fully integrated** with Time Authority Model B (SCR controls time, ATN enhances with events)
- **Calendar selection dialog** with compact UI when multiple calendars are detected
- Settings UI shows which system manages time (ATN vs SCR) with smart checkbox disabling when needed
- Time routing through adapter pattern ensures proper delegation to calendar systems
- All existing events continue to work (timestamp-based storage is calendar-agnostic)

## Compatibility

- Foundry VTT: v13+
- System compatibility: Universal
- Simple Calendar Reborn
- Seasons and Stars
- D&D5e 5.2 calandar
