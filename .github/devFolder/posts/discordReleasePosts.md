**About Time Next — v13.5.0.0 released (2026-01-10)**

🎉 **Major Update:** Simple Calendar Reborn Integration!

After years of waiting, Simple Calendar has been reborn for Foundry v13+ and we've fully integrated it into About Time Next.

**What's New:**
• Full Simple Calendar Reborn (SCR) support with proper time authority
• Neutral calendar selection - all calendars treated equally
• Smart calendar detection dialog when multiple systems available
• Enhanced settings UI with time authority indicators
• Optimized compact calendar selection dialog

When SCR is active, it controls worldTime while ATN enhances it with event scheduling, elapsed time tracking, and additional UI controls.
